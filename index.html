    <header class="maintext">Galileo's life</header>
    <h1 class="facts">He was born in Pisa, Italy, on the 15th of February 1564.</h1>
    <h1 class="facts">He was the eldest of 6 children.</h1>
    <h1 class="facts">His father was a music teacher and a famous musician.</h1>
    <h1 class="facts">Initially, he went to university to study medicine however, he changed his mind and went on to study philosophy and mathematics. In 1589, he became Professor of Mathematics at the University of Pisa and in 1592 he moved to become Mathematics Professor at the University of Padua. During this time, he worked on a variety of experiments such as the speed at which different objects fall, mechanics and pendulums.</h1>
    <h1 class="facts">The Catholic Church did not like Galileo's findings. They forbid him from writing or teaching about his works but Galileo didn't listen so he was tried and found guilty and put under house arrest. He carried on writing while he was under house arrest and later became blind. He died on January 8th, 1642. After Galileo died, the Catholic Church decided he wasn't so bad after all.</h1>
    <h1 class="text">Fun fact: Galileo's right hand middle finger is currently on exhibition at the Museo Galileo in Florence, Italy.</h1>

    <header class="maintext">Inventions and Discoveries</header>
    <h1 class="facts">The telescope is a big part in astronomy. Galileo didn't invent the telescope, but he greatly improved on it. The original telescope had only 3x zoom, but Galileo's telescope had 30x zoom. Using his telescope, he discovered the 4 largest moons on Jupiter.</h1>
    <h1 class="facts">Most of Galileo's discoveries were not believed by anyone and were debated a lot. At the time, it was believed that the Earth was the center of the universe with everything rotating around it but Galileo and some other scientists came up with a more accurate model. They discovered that everything orbits around the sun. They called it the heliocentric model. The Catholic Church didn't take kindly to this as it went against their beliefs and they put him under lifetime house arrest.</h1>
    <h1 class="facts">He also invented a thermometer, a compass and a pendulum design.</h1>
    <h1 class="facts">Galileo was different to other scientists at the time. He wanted to test all the principles and try and see them happening in the real world. He basically started what is known as the scientific method, test, test and test</h1>
    <h1 class="text">Fun Fact: He was a very good musician, just like his father!</h1>
